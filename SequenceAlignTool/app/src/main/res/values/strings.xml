        <h4>Instructions</h4>

            <li>
            "To start using the app, simply select the initialize button at the top of the actionbar. Enter two sequences of size 6 or less. Select an alignment method (global by default), a scoring method (score by default), an insert/delete cost (-2 by default), a match cost (+1 by default), and a mismatch cost (-1 by default). Then select the “ok” button. An alignment at the top of the page will appear, indicating how the two sequences line up. Below the alignment is a 2D matrix that highlights the traceback path and includes arrows, which indicate where values from the matrix came from."
