        <h4>Edit Distance</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Minimum number of operators/mutations (insert, delete, replace) required to transform one sequence into the other</li>
            <li>Penalty = amount paid (subtracted) per mismatch</li>
            <li>Why is edit distance disabled for everything but global alignment?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                Since local alignment always has an option to choose 0 as a minimum value for any cell and edit distance can only increase, 
                the matrix will end up being filled with only zeroes since the algorithm will see that as the best choice always.

        <h4>Score</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Consider different values for insert, delete, replace, matches with both positive and negative values</li>
            <li>Match = penalty paid when the matched letters in the sequence are same, must be 0 or a positive number</li>
            <li>Mismatch = penalty paid when the matched letters in the sequence are not same</li>
            <li>Insert/delete = penalty paid to insert or delete a letter from one sequence</li>
        </ul>
