            <li>BLOSUM-k (BLOcks SUbstitution Matrix) is a scoring matrix that shows the relationship between ith and jth letters. 
                The matrix is created by clustering similar sequences (where K represents the percentage of sequences that were identical) into one single sequence and then comparing those sequences. 
                In the matrix, positive numbers indicate that mutation between the two letters is likely. The magnitude of the number shows the degree of proximity.
